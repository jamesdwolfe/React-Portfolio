    "bio":"I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in JavaScript and manipulating it as much as I could to get the results I desired, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. This passion carried me through my education at The University of Southern California. At this school there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined. I studied new languages, algorithms, data structures, compilers, software methodologies, all with the same fascination that drove me when I first started programming. It was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn. Now, with my sights on the industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly more to learn, more problems to solve, and more solutions I'll build. For this, I am grateful.",
